Execution:
- To execute the program, the "test" and "train" files will need to be in the same directory as the python file.
- The text file "stopWords.txt" must also be in the directory as the python file.
- Finally, line 13 of the python file contains a variable named "basePath". Set this variable
to the path of the directory the python program is running from.
